# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control
Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people.

Why is it useful?
It is useful because of in case there is an error on the documents we can roll back to any point in the past.we can also view who made any changes so we know who play a part in the changes of the document.

* What is a branch  and why would you use one?
A branch is an istruction that allows the computer to execute a different sequence without affecting the default working branch.
It is useful to use one because it allows you 
to know exactly what code is running on your servers and to keep the default working branch stable.

* What is a commit?
A commit is a message that describes a save point for future reference.

 What makes a good commit message?
 A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit. some examples are: "Create user profile", "Add form field for user's age" and "Add cute kitten pictures to header".

* What is a merge conflict?
 A merge conflict happens when merging or pulling from a branch. when there is a divergence between the current branch and the one that you want to merge into you have  a merge conflict.In order words you have commits in the current branch which are not in the other branch and vice versa.
